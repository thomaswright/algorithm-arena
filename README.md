## #1 - Stockfish Chess

Implement a program to play chess 1v1 against a bot using the normal chess rules. The twist is that you need to use stockfish to spice up the game in an interesting way.

## #3 - Bouncy Form

Implement a form with a bouncy ball that follows you around as you fill it and implements the "Squash & Stretch" technique from Disney's 12 Principles of Animation. The only restriction on the form is that there must be at least 5 fields to fill out.

## #4 - Encrypted Thread

Implement a Twitter/X/Threads experience where you can see a thread and reply to it. The entire data of the thread must live in the URL and be end to end encrypted. You can take inspiration from [this blog post that explains how it works on Excalidraw](https://blog.excalidraw.com/end-to-end-encryption/). The hashtag part of the URL must be below 2000 characters.

## #5 - Copy Pasta

Implement a program that you can paste content in a certain format, and it will let you copy this content in a different format (eg: text/plain, text/html, image/png). You need to support at least 3 formats and they must form a loop such that you can keep copy pasting in an infinite loop.
